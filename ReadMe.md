## Description ü¶ö
**ReacTube**, is a simple, single page, privacy friendly & distraction free YouTube front-end based on [Piped APIs](https://piped-docs.kavin.rocks/docs/api-documentation/). ReacTube does not contain features like subscriptions, library, registrations etc. It is designed in order to just search and watch, i.e. to be focused and particular about what user wants to watch rather than wasting time with recommendations or handling subscriptions etc.
Its aim is to provides a simple and smooth user experience with features including:

 - **PWA** 
 - **Trendings**  
 - **Search Results** 
 - **Streaming videos** 
 - **Dark Mode**

## ToDo

- [ ] in-app instance selection
- [ ] Redirection: An easy way to redirect YouTube links to this frontend. 
- [ ] Hide Trending (optional) : only have a search bar on the home page.
- [ ] Media Queue: Either enqueue, or at least to play videos in a single playlist consecutively.
